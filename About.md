# Contract

Introduction

Solidity is a contract-oriented, high-level language whose syntax is similar to that of JavaScript and it is designed to
target the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defines types among other features.
As you will see, it is possible to create contracts for voting, crowdfunding, blind auctions, multi-signature wallets and
more.


Note: The best way to try out Solidity right now is using the Browser-Based Compiler
