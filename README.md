# Contract

# Introduction

Solidity is a contract-oriented, high-level language whose syntax is similar to that of JavaScript and it is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defines types among other features. As you will see, it is possible to create contracts for voting, crowdfunding, blind auctions, multi-signature wallets and more.

Note: The best way to try out Solidity right now is using the Browser-Based Compiler
